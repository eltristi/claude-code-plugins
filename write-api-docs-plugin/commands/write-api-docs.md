description: Generate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for Laravel APIs
---

Use the write-api-docs skill to help me generate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for this Laravel project.

Follow the skill's workflow:
1. Analyze all API endpoints from routes/api.php
2. List endpoints and confirm with me
3. Show an example annotation for my approval
4. Implement documentation for each endpoint
5. Generate JSON+YAML with zero warnings
